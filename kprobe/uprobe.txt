Uprobe
---
Uprobe based trace events are similar to kprobe based trace events.
To enable this feature, build your kernel with CONFIG_UPROBE_EVENTS=y.

Similar to the kprobe-event tracer, this doesn't need to be activated via
current_tracer. Instead of that, add probe points via
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/uprobe_events, and enable it via
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/uprobes/<EVENT>/enabled.

Example
---
Following example shows how to dump the instruction pointer and %ax register
at the probed text address. Probe zfree function in /bin/zsh:

    # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
    # cat /proc/`pgrep zsh`/maps | grep /bin/zsh | grep r-xp
    00400000-0048a000 r-xp 00000000 08:03 130904 /bin/zsh
    # objdump -T /bin/zsh | grep -w zfree
    0000000000446420 g    DF .text  0000000000000012  Base        zfree

  0x46420 is the offset of zfree in object /bin/zsh that is loaded at
  0x00400000. Hence the command to uprobe would be:

    # echo 'p:zfree_entry /bin/zsh:0x46420 %ip %ax' > uprobe_events

  And the same for the uretprobe would be:

    # echo 'r:zfree_exit /bin/zsh:0x46420 %ip %ax' >> uprobe_events

Q: separate debug symbol files when using uprobes?
A: Recommanding to use gdb
