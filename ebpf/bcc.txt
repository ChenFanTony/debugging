BCC(BPF Compiler Collection)
===
bcc provides libbcc, libbpf liberary to support high level function
bcc-tools use bcc to support python, C, etc.. to trace system profile.
but bpftrace usually trace the kprobe to examine the issue.
bcc-tools can be isntalled in verious distrutions. which are python format
that encapsule libbpf.

for rhel:
After dnf install bcc-tools, all tools can be found in folder:
  /usr/share/bcc/tools/
for ubuntu:
After apt install bpfcc-tools, we can use bcc as:
Bcc: biosnoop-bpfcc // require python, bcc, inplace compiling
bpftrace: biosnoop.bt // require bcc, btf

detail:
  execsnoop: trace new process call exec() or process created.
  biolatency: show disk latency as a histogram.
  ext4slower/xfsslower: trace io slower than X ms
  tcpconnect: trace each time tcp connect
  tcpretans: trace each time tcp retansmission
  runqlat: trace run queue latency
  profile: sample at XX Hertz all hreads's stack
